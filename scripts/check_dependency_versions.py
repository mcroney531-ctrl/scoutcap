"""
Reports the installed versions of scoutcap's direct runtime
dependencies against the exact pins in requirements.txt, so a future
deployment drifting from the known-good baseline (Stage 2C-5) is easy to
spot -- a `pip install` that silently picked up something different, a
base image change, or a manual dependency bump that forgot to update
requirements.txt.

Deliberately NOT part of the offline test suite: it depends on which
packages happen to be installed in whatever environment runs it, and that
varies between a bare dev sandbox (which may not have every dependency
installed at all) and a real Scout environment -- the offline
suite has to pass in either, so a hard version assertion doesn't belong
there. Run this after any dependency-affecting deploy, or locally after
`pip install -r requirements.txt`, to confirm what's pinned is what's
actually there.
